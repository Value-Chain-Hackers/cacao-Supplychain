                    <div>
                        <p>Cacao (Theobroma cacao) is a tropical tree native to the deep tropical regions of the Americas. Its seeds, called cacao beans, are the main ingredient in chocolate production.</p>
                        <p>The cacao tree produces large, pod-like fruits, each containing 20 to 60 beans surrounded by a sweet, white pulp. These beans undergo a complex journey before becoming the chocolate we enjoy.</p>
                        <p>Cacao has been cultivated for at least three millennia in Mexico, Central America, and Northern South America. Today, about 70% of the world's cacao is grown in West Africa, with Ivory Coast being the largest producer.</p>

                        <h3>1. Farming</h3>
                        <div class="placeholder">Farming Icon</div>
                        <p>Cacao trees are grown in tropical environments within 20Â° of the equator. They require specific conditions including regular rainfall, high humidity, and protection from direct sunlight.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="step">
                        <h3>2. Harvesting</h3>
                        <div class="placeholder">Harvesting Icon</div>
                        <p>Cacao pods are harvested by hand using machetes or knives. The pods are opened to extract the beans and pulp, which are then fermented together.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="step">
                        <h3>3. Fermentation</h3>
                        <div class="placeholder">Fermentation Icon</div>
                        <p>The beans and pulp ferment for 5-7 days, developing flavor precursors. This crucial step determines much of the chocolate's final flavor profile.</p>

                        <div class="placeholder">Drying Icon</div>
                        <p>After fermentation, beans are dried in the sun for several days until their moisture content is reduced to about 7%, preventing mold growth during transport.</p>

                        <p>Dried beans are sold to local traders, who sell to exporters, who then sell to international traders or directly to chocolate manufacturers.</p>

                        <div class="placeholder">Processing Icon</div>
                        <p>Beans are cleaned, roasted, and have their shells removed. The resulting cacao nibs are ground into a paste called chocolate liquor.</p>
